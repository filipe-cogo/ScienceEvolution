  title = {Using {RPG} and {MABS} in the Development of Group Decision Support Systems},
  abstract = {This paper proposes the integrated use of RPG (Role-Playing Games) and MABS (Multi-Agent-Based Simulation) techniques to develop Group Decision Support Systems (GDSS), using GMABS methodology. Natural resources management was the chosen domain to implement GDSS, because in this domain negotiation process is extremely important and complex. Two prototypes are presented, JogoMan and ViP-JogoMan, showing that GMABS methodology can be applied to GDSS and can bring excellent results in negotiation process.},

  title = {Cache coherence and awareness in mobile cooperation environments},
  abstract = {The advance of mobile computing and the new ways of connectivity allow the integration of mobile devices in collaborative applications. However, there are many restrictions so that a successful integration can be accomplished. The restrictions include the screen size of mobile devices, limited battery power and maintenance related to cache coherence. Nowadays, a great deal of collaborative applications considers only strongly coupled environments where disconnection is not a problem. The goal of this paper is to present a mechanism to deal with cache coherence which occurs in weakly coupled environments, and the awareness in collaborative applications.},

  title = {Design Rationale Model for Outpatient Treatment},
  abstract = {In a health care environment, it is not very usual interactions between of health care professionals. This work shows that electronic medical records available do not favor this kind of interaction and propose a design rationale based model applied to health care. This model is an extension to the electronic medical record and it intends to help health care professionals on collaborative work.},

  title = {{WebBEMS}: component based system to support collaboration via Web},
  abstract = {Component-based development has been increasingly used in the development of collaborative services and systems. Software components allow solving several problems related to the distribution of collaborative systems. Besides, components can be configured, replaced and combined dynamically, increasing the flexibility, integration and adequacy of collaborative systems. This paper presents the development of an electronic meeting system named Web-Based Electronic Meeting System (WebBEMS), according to an architectural model conceived for the development of component-based collaborative systems. The paper depicts details of modeling, implementation and test of the application starting from the components architecture until its user interface.},

  title = {Inter and Intra-relationships between Communication, Coordination and Cooperation},
  abstract = {Based on the 3C Collaboration Model, in this article is described the mapping of a variety of collaborations forms onto the inter-relations between communication, coordination and cooperation. It is also seen that, in virtue of the intra-relations between these dimensions, it is necessary to give computational support for these three collaboration dimensions independently of the groupware specific purpose. These inter- and intra-relations are considered in the Groupware Engineering development cycle.},

  title = {{Giga-Colab}: An architecture of colaborative virtual environment with support to multimedia services},
  abstract = {The development of collaborative and multimedia systems is a complex task and one of the key challenges is to promote the reuse and integration of those two software categories in the same environment. This paper presents an extensible collaborative virtual environment architecture based on client-server model, taking advantage of services oriented approach and open multimedia standards (ISMA, H.323 and SIP) .To validate this proposal, a prototype of a collaborative virtual environment was developed, supporting two multimedia applications: video on demand and videoconference. The project had as target the Giga Network (RNP/CPqD) and had as its main requirement the support of high definition video, resulting in some challenging issues to overcome.},

  title = {Co-browsing System with Support to Audio-Conference},
  abstract = {Co-browsing allows several users synchronizing their browsing activities, from different computers. The CoLab tool provides simple and powerful synchronization facilities for dynamically organizing co-browsing sessions. Users are allowed to create independent workgroups in the same co-browsing session. However, for effectively co-browsing, it is important to employ a communication tool in order to allow users to discuss about co-browsed subjects. This paper presents a proposal for integrating CoLab with an audio-conference controller. In order to integrate these two applications, we adopted the integration environment for collaborative applications.},

  title = {A context based knowledge management model},
  abstract = {Knowledge Management (KM) has become a prominent subject for organizations, but often characterization and treatment of the information that flows in a well-defined work process are muddled. We argue that context is the fundamental information resource for better understanding and carrying on activities and interactions. Therefore, we propose a model to support the cycle of creating and dealing with information about process activities and interaction performed, focusing on their context. The goal of this paper is to present the model and also to specify mechanisms that can be used to capture context information within the KM environment.},

  abstract = {Several organizations have adopted the distributed software development paradigm as a mean to reduce costs and development time, and also improve quality of products. As a consequence of geographic distribution of such organizations, tools and platforms are needed to improve collaboration and to control the software production process. In such a context, this paper presents a collaborative infrastructure for supporting component-based distributed development, which integrates facilities for access control, configuration management, version control and reuse metrics management.},

  title = {A Technical Comparison of Existent Approaches for Implementing Collaborative Requirements in Non-Collaborative Applications},
  abstract = {Many approaches can be used to facilitate the implementation of collaborative requirements on non-collaborative applications. Each approach uses different design techniques and has specific objectives and pre-conditions. During the implementation of collaborative requirements is not always easy to decide which approach is the most recommended i.e. which criteria should be used to compare the approaches. Based on the literature work, this paper presents a set of technical criteria to technically compare the existing approaches to implement collaborative requirements on non-collaborative applications. With these criteria, the developers can choose the most suitable approach to implement collaborative requirements on non-collaborative applications.},
