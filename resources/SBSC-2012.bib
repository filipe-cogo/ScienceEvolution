  title = {Domain Analysis for Mechanism of Awareness in Social Networking in the Web 2.0},
  abstract = {Awareness is a natural human characteristic. However, in a virtual environment, the perception is impaired due to systems limitations. Social networks are systems which many interactions among users take place and it becomes necessary to provide awareness support. There is no standard to give its support and each social network provides it in your own way. This paper presents a domain analysis using the FODA method, based on the 3C collaboration model (communication, coordination and cooperation) and the types of awareness (social, workspace and activities) to classify the features found.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have shown that social presence is a central concept in online education. Interactions enhance the social presence, which is characterized by the potential of participation, involvement and visibility of individuals in relation to themselves, to others and to the environment. The purpose of this qualitative study was to identify social presence in a collective writing environment - Wikispaces. The 3C Model, which guides the design and implementation of collaborative systems, was used for analysis. Results showed that the awareness element of 3C Model is fundamental for the identification of social presence in a collective space.},

  title = {May Social Behavior Reveal Preferences on Different Contexts? Recommending Movie Titles Based on Tweets},
  abstract = {Recommendation systems allow users to deal with information overload by generating personalized recommendations that guide them through the universe of available options. These systems have been successfully used for over a decade in various application domains. However, most recommendation techniques do not consider context, generating recommendations which do not consider user's daily generated information. The increasing use of social networks and microblogs has created a valuable source to extract information that might help improve the results of recommender systems. Specifically, microblogging messages may help on contextualized movie recommendation. In this paper, a hybrid recommender is proposed merging a collaborative filtering recommender with a content based recommender. The results confirm the usefulness of the proposed recommender, where the user's exchanged messages define a bias to insert context in the recommendations.},

A new approach for that is the use of NeuroLinguistic theory to determine what is the Preferred Representational cognitive System (PRS) of collaborators. Internal mental processes such as problem solving, memory, and language consist of visual, auditory and kinesthetic representations.

Because this kind of environment provides a natural and informal way to people engage on collaborative activities, this kind of initiative can be a good alternative approach to achieve better results in knowledge management initiatives. In this context, it was conducted an action research to investigate how a Web based social network could be used as the main tool in a knowledge management initiative being held in an innovation institute. During this action research, the Web based social network was proposed and developed to meet the knowledge management needs of the organization. In the five years span in which the action research was carried out, a set of metrics were proposed, monitored and analyzed, originating some improvement proposals for both, the initiative and the social network environment. Through the deployment of these proposals, it was possible to monitor the impacts of the proposals on the organization. At the end, this action research showed some reflections and conclusions on the whole initiative.},

Therefore, the proper management of this knowledge has become a real need in the software development industry. One of the approaches to encourage knowledge transfer is its adequate formalization. This method can facilitate knowledge learning and usage. However, knowledge formalization is not trivial and there are several related strategies. This paper presents a qualitative study, in which we compared two knowledge codification support strategies: ABC-Pattern and Mind Map. The results indicate that the participants had a preference in using the ABC-Pattern approach due to its usage and utility. We identified some of the reasons for this preference: a) more codification detail, b) a more detailed description of the knowledge's scenario which is more clarifying, c) the possibility of acquiring more information with less effort, and d) the possibility of describing both the problem and the solution.},

In order to become a good developer the student needs to refine his learning outcomes to foresee beyond syntax and semantics of a programming language. However, we found that many students face difficulties in that learning process. Thus, it is important to adopt strategies that best fits this situation in order to provide the necessary conditions to achieve success. For that purpose a tool provided with resources for the teachers to plan group problem solving exercises would help students keeping themselves engaged on the programming activities. In this regard we are developing scenarios using virtual worlds. Such environments have been used on many educational contexts, and we believe that if we include Polya's problem solving method as a means for start solving the collaborative tasks described within the scenarios students will propose strategies for solving the tasks, formalize them later on as algorithms. Those activities will promote integration between teacher and students at the same time as students practice their algorithm building skills.},
