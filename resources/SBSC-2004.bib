  title = {Process Beans for Supporting Post Meeting Activities},
  crossref = {proceedings:wcscw:2004},
  abstract = {The lack of appropriate support to post-meeting activities may compromise the expected results of the decisions made in a meeting. Without an appropriate follow-up, decisions may get lost or be wrongly implemented. This paper discusses a proposal to support the planning, control and follow-up of decisions. The approach is based on the use of workflow systems for designing and performing the implementation procedures of meeting decisions. A set of process patterns common to decision implementations was defined and an application -- SUPRE -- was developed.},

  title = {A Metamodel to Cooperative Systems},
  crossref = {proceedings:wcscw:2004},
  abstract = {Cooperation models and theories have long been recognized as an important aid in the development of Computer Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) systems. However, there is no consensus regarding the set of concepts and abstractions that should underlie such developments. Besides, common patterns in these models are hard to discern. This paper analyses a number of existing models and theories, and proposes a generic cooperative work metamodel based on the studies models.},

  crossref = {proceedings:wcscw:2004},
  abstract = {Collaborative systems are especially prone to failure and should be flexible in order to be adapted to the group characteristics and to the work processes evolution. The new architecture of the AulaNet learning environment was developed using component-based techniques to provide the necessary flexibility. A case study regarding the forum service of the environment is presented to show how a tool can be adapted to accompany the evolution of the course dynamics.},

  title = {{TellStory}: Groupware for Supporting Knowledge Management},
  crossref = {proceedings:wcscw:2004},
  abstract = {Knowledge Management has becoming fundamental for organizations. However, explicit the tacit knowledge used in the projects execution, such as discussions and decisions, is a complex task. Other challenge is to deal with collective knowledge, once most of the work in organizations is group made. In this paper, histories are presented as a tool for externalization of the tacit knowledge and is described the groupware Tellstory for supporting this group activity.},

  crossref = {proceedings:wcscw:2004},
  abstract = {Awareness mechanisms are an alternative to reduce the isolation among group members. They can be used on software model concurrent editing, guiding software developers to coordinate future actions. This paper presents MAIS mechanism and prototype, which collects, distributes and presents workspace awareness information (change information). Beside this, relevance and acknowledge rates are evaluated to reduce cognitive and visual overload.},

  crossref = {proceedings:wcscw:2004},
  abstract = {In this paper we describe a new approach that uses Artificial Intelligence Planning techniques in the development of a Workflow System. Our approach allows the automatic generation of process diagrams and makes use of the recent developments in the planning field. Also, we propose the use of an execution mechanism on Situated Control Rules, which provides features of reactivity and adaptability.},

  title = {Structuring Participants Interactions in Collaborative Learning Environments},
  crossref = {proceedings:wcscw:2004},
  abstract = {The interaction is the key element used in Collaborative Learning Environments to understand the process of knowledge building and the role played by each student in that process. The analysis of the interaction can provide ways to support the individual and/or group needs, as well as improve the evaluation of different aspects (such as attitudes, weaknesses, knowledge level) of group/individuals behavior. In this paper we propose an argumentation model to organize the group interaction in learning environments and thus allow further analysis. The proposed model was integrated into an intelligent environment for collaborative discussions called SmartChat, and then validated. The initial tests have yielded promising results.},

There are several types of tools with different characteristics. The focus of this paper is to describe and to evaluate these tools. The objective is to provide methods that can help developers and users of definition tools in the description and evaluation of concepts, functionalities and interactions of these tools.},
